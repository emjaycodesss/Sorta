# Project Rules: API Authentication & Validation Guidelines

## 1. Goal

This document outlines the **mandatory** rules and procedures for creating and modifying API endpoints within the Hearth App codebase ('src/pages/api/') and for interacting with these endpoints from the frontend or other backend services. The primary goals are to ensure **security**, **consistency**, and **maintainability** by standardizing how authentication, method validation, and request data validation are handled. Adherence to these guidelines is critical for preventing security vulnerabilities and ensuring predictable API behavior.

**All new API endpoints and API calls (frontend or backend) MUST follow these rules**

## 2. Core Principles

* **Security First:** Authentication and validation are non-negotiable.
* **Consistency:** Use the established utility functions and patterns.
* **Leverage Utilities:** Utilize the provided higher-order functions and 'src/utils/auth/' for backend API endpoints, and the specific fetch
* **Clear Separation:** API routes handle HTTP requests/responses. Frontend functions. Backend services may call shared logic directly or use specific helper API calls.
